It looks like they don't allow us to pick an algorithm to solve min-cost flow

## LEMON
I think we're going to use this one, it has 

# Algorithms

## Network Simplex
Big O is $O(VE\log(V)\log(VC))$

## Cost Scaling
Big O is $O(V^2 E \log(VC))$

## Capacity Scaling
Big O is $O(E \log U (V+E) \log V)$

## Cycle Cancelling
Big O is $O(V^2 E^2 \log(V))$
