# mincost-matching
STATS 606 Project with Josh Garman, Yizhou Gu, and Samuel Rosenberg.  

[Here's our proposal](https://www.overleaf.com/project/67c09af38492f9512e9b49d7)

## To-dos before our March 21st meeting
We'll split into two pairs

### Sam and Yizhou
- Figure out the data generating processes

### Julian and Josh
- Look through implementations of min-cost flow algorithms in Python
    - Pick a candidate set of min-cost flow algorithms
    - Make a table of algorithms, big O, and availability
    - Decide from this table which algorithsm we'll use
- Decide on matching configuration
    - Probably mostly Julian
